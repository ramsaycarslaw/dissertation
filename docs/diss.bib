  abstract = {We describe a full implementation of algebraic effects and handlers as a
library in standard and portable C99, where effect operations can be used
just like regular C functions. We use a formal operational semantics to
guide the C implementation at every step where an evaluation context
corresponds directly to a particular C execution context. Finally we show
a novel extension to the formal semantics to describe optimized tail
resumptions and prove that the extension is sound. This gives two orders
of magnitude improvement to the performance of tail resumptive operations
(up to about 150 million operations per second on a Core i7@2.6GHz)},

Most of the computing agents with which computing science is concerned exhibit behavior that is not just the computation of a mathematical function of their inputs but rather a possibly infinite sequence of communications with their environment. The mathematics of processes promises to unify the behavioral study of computing agents, both hardware and software. This chapter describes the concepts that may be useful in modeling the behavior of intercommunicating agents, together with some examples. It is becoming clear that informal (but rigorous) proofs about communicating systems, analogous to proofs about serial programs based on the assertion technique introduced by Floyd and others, are considerably harder to express.}

abstract = {As a central part of resource management, the OS thread scheduler must maintain the following, simple, invariant: make sure that ready threads are scheduled on available cores. As simple as it may seem, we found that this invariant is often broken in Linux. Cores may stay idle for seconds while ready threads are waiting in runqueues. In our experiments, these performance bugs caused many-fold performance degradation for synchronization-heavy scientific applications, 13\% higher latency for kernel make, and a 14-23\% decrease in TPC-H throughput for a widely used commercial database. The main contribution of this work is the discovery and analysis of these bugs and providing the fixes. Conventional testing techniques and debugging tools are ineffective at confirming or understanding this kind of bugs, because their symptoms are often evasive. To drive our investigation, we built new tools that check for violation of the invariant online and visualize scheduling activity. They are simple, easily portable across kernel versions, and run with a negligible overhead. We believe that making these tools part of the kernel developers' tool belt can help keep this type of bug at bay.},
