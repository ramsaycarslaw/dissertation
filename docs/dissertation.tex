\section{Algebraic Effects and Effect Handlers}

Algebraic effects \cite{plotkin2002computational} and their corresponding
handlers \cite{plotkin2009handlers} \cite{pretnar2015introduction} are a
programming paradigm that when paired together offers a novel way to compose
programs. It starts with the definition of the effect or the \emph{effect
signature} that gives the effect a name in scope and specifies any input and
the return type otherwise known as the \emph{effect operation}. At this stage
the effect operation has no implementation and is more an acknowledgement to
the compiler that it should expect an implementation. For this reason any
function that references these effect operations is known as an \emph{effectful
function} or a function whose definition is not complete without an effect
handler. The \emph{effect handler} provides one implementation of the given
effect operation. In this way, we can change the semantics of an effectful
function by handling it with a different handler that provides an alternative
implementation to the effect. 

When programs are written that are `black boxes', that is to say their outputs
are defined entirely by their inputs and all functions are pure computation
\cite{hughes1989functional}, it is safe to make assumptions about the inputs.
Assumptions like an age will always be given as an integer or all strings will
not exceed the length allocated for them. When programs interact with the real
world it is no longer safe to make these assumptions. Effects allow the
programmer to encapsulate these side effects and `handle' them with control
flow.

\subsection{Example}

For an example see section \ref{subsection:unison} on implementing a \emph{put/store} handler in Unison.

% \subsection{Example: Heads and Tails}

% Consider the following example of heads or tails written
% conventionally.

% \begin{lstlisting}
% function choose() -> bool {
%   if (rand() > 0.5) {
%     return true
%   }
%   return false
% }

% function flip() -> string {
%   if (choose() == true) {
%     return `Heads'
%   } else {
%     return `Tails'
%   }
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% The function choose returns true or false randomly, with equal probability and
% flip uses the result of chose to print heads on true and tails on false. This
% works fine but if we wanted multiple definitions of choose where we alter the
% probability or add an option for failure we would have to rewrite each function
% for each implementation.

% We can use effects handlers as described by Pretnar et al
% \cite{pretnar2015introduction} to provide a generic implementation of choose
% that can be handled by flip. The following is an example of choose implemented
% with effects.

% \begin{lstlisting}
% effect Choose {
%   choose : () -> bool
% }

% function choose() -> bool {
%   invoke choose()
% }

% function flip() -> string {
%   if (choose() == true) {
%     return `Heads'
%   } else {
%     return `Tails'
%   }
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% The effect Choose is defined with a single operation choose that takes no
% arguments and returns a boolean. The function choose is defined as a wrapper
% that simply invokes the choose effect. The function flip is unchanged from the
% previous example. We can now define a \emph{handler} that provides the
% implementation details for choose. To get the same result as before we could do
% the following.

% \begin{lstlisting}
% function fairToss(value, resume) {
%   if (rand() > 0.5) {
%     resume(true)
%   }
%   resume(false)
% }

% handle flip() with fairToss
% \end{lstlisting}

% Here we split the effect into the value and the remaining computation,
% \emph{resume}. Depending on the rand function we continue the computation with
% either true or false as the value for choose. The true power of effects comes when we define multiple handlers for one effect for example we can make the coin weighted:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% function unfairToss(value, resume) {
%   if (rand() > 0.75) {
%     resume(true)
%   }
%   resume(false)
% }

% handle flip() with unfairToss
% \end{lstlisting}

% Or even get heads and tails at once by returning the result of both true and
% false in a list.

% \begin{lstlisting}
% function both(value, resume) {
%   resume(true) ++ resume(false)
% }

% handle flip() with both
% \end{lstlisting}

% We get all of these without changing either of our original definitions. This
% is the expressive power of algebraic effect handlers.

\section{Shallow vs. Deep Effect Handlers}

There are two types of effect handler implementation, \emph{deep handlers}, as
originally defined by Plotkin and Pretnar \cite{plotkin2009handlers} and
\emph{shallow handlers} \cite{hillerstrom2018shallow}. In practice deep handlers
pass themselves with the computation allowing for them to be invoked again.
Certain methods such as introducing a Continuation Passing Style allow for
shallow handlers to implement behaviour normally reserved for deep handlers.

\section{Affine and `Multi-Shot' Handlers}

If a continuation can be invoked only once we call it an \emph{affine} or
\emph{one-shot} handler.  If it can be invoked multiple times then it is
\emph{multi-shot}.

\section{The State of Effect-Oriented Programming}

\subsection{Library Based Effects}

\begin{itemize}
        \item{libhandler \cite{leijen2017implementing} is a portable c99 library
that implements algebraic effect handlers for C. It implements high performance
multi-shot effects using standard C functions. It is limited by the assumptions
it makes about the stack such as it being contiguous and not moving. In practice
this could lead to memory leaks if it copies pointers.}
        \item{libmprompt \footnote{https://github.com/koka-lang/libmprompt} is a
C/C++ library that adds effect handlers. It uses virtual memory to solve the
problem mentioned with libhandler. By keeping the stack in a fixed location in
virtual memory it restores safety. It also provides the higher level libmpeff
interface. A downside is they recommend at least 2GiB of virtual memory to
allow for 16000 stacks which may be challenging on some systems.}
        \item{cpp-effects \cite{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/GhicaLBP22} is a C++
implementation of effect handlers. It uses C++ template classes and types to
create modular effects and handlers. It's performance has been shown to be
comparable to C++20 coroutines. It's limitations are it only supports one-shot
        resumptions.}
        \item{There are several Haskell libraries that implement effect handlers
\cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/XieL20, DBLP:conf/haskell/KiselyovI15,
DBLP:conf/haskell/WuSH14}. Some are discussed in more detail below.}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item{EvEff uses lambda calculus based evidence translation to
implement it's effects system. It provides deep effects.}
          \item{fused-effects
\footnote{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects} fuses the effect
handlers it provides with computation by applying \emph{fusion laws} that avoid
intermediate representation. The handlers in fused-effects are one-shot
however.}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{First-Class Effects}

\begin{itemize}
        \item{Unison \footnote{https://github.com/unisonweb/unison} is a
function language implemented in Haskell that offers built in support for effect
handlers through it's abilities system. Unison is shown in more detail in section \ref{subsection:unison}}
        \item{Koka \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Leijen14} is a statically typed
functional language with effect types and handlers. It can also compile
straight to C code without needing a garbage collector. Koka is developed by a
small team and as such is still missing much of its standard library.}
        \item{Frank \cite{DBLP:conf/popl/LindleyMM17} is a strict functional
language that is \emph{effectful} in that it has first class support for
bi-directional effects and effect handlers. }
        \item{Links \cite{DBLP:conf/fmco/CooperLWY06} is a functional
programming language designed for the web. Out of the box it does not support
true algebraic effects, however through an extension
\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/HillerstromL16} it gains first class support for
continuations.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unison}
\label{subsection:unison}

Unison provides the \emph{ability} keyword which allows users to define their own
effects. It also provides the \emph{handle ... with ...} pattern to attach handlers to effectful functions.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The \emph{put} and \emph{store} example in Unison. Note that the \emph{structural} keyword refers to the fact that Unison stores type definitions as a hash. Even if we changed all the variable names it would still view it as the same type. To avoid that behaviour you can swap the \emph{structural} keyword for \emph{unique}}]
structural ability Store a where
  put: a -> {Store a} ()
  get: {Store a} a
\end{lstlisting}

This defines the two effect operations \texttt{put} and \texttt{get} that have
the effect signature \texttt{Store a}. Put takes a value of type \texttt{a} and
returns the unit type \texttt{()}. The prefix of \texttt{\{Store a\}} to the
\texttt{()}, refers to the fact that in order to allow for \texttt{put} to
return, it must be run from an effectful function that is handled with an
appropriate handler for \texttt{Store a}. Similarly, \texttt{put} takes an
argument of type \texttt{a} and must be handled.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={An example of an effectful function that uses the \texttt{Store} effect}]
addStore : a -> {Store a} ()
addStore x =
  y = get
  put (x + y)
\end{lstlisting}
\label{listing:addstore}

The code in listing \ref{listing:addstore} is an example of how you would use
the effects in Unison. It takes an argument of type \texttt{a} and `adds' it to
the current value by using \texttt{get}. Note that in order for this to work the
infix operation `+' must be implemented for type \texttt{a}. Now we only need to
define the handler.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The handler for the \texttt{Store} effect}]
    storeHandler : a -> Request (Store a) a -> a
    storeHandler value = cases
        {Store.get -> resume} -> handle resume value with storeHandler value
        {Store.put v -> resume} handle resume () with storeHandler v
        {result} -> result

\end{lstlisting}

The handlers in Unison use tail recursion to reduce to the case where just the
value is left \texttt{result -> result}. For both store and put we use the
resumption and the handler to reach the final value. The special type
\texttt{Request} allows us to perform pattern matching on the possible types of
the computation.

\begin{lstlisting}
handle !(addStore 10) with storeHandler 10
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, we can put it all together by calling the function \texttt{addStore}
with the handler \texttt{storeHandler}. The \texttt{addStore 10} is a delayed
function due to it using effects. This means it will not run until we tell it to
avoid errors with the handlers. Given we are handling it we force it to run with
`!'.

\section{\textsc{UNIX}}

\textsc{Unix} \cite{ritchie1978unix} is an operating system designed and
implemented by Dennis M. Ritchie and Ken Thompson at AT\&T's Bell Labs in 1974.
It provides a file system (directories, file protection etc.), a shell,
processes (pipe, fork etc) and a userspace. Since it's first release it has been
reimplemented for a variety of systems.

\subsection{The UNIX Philosophy}

A phrase often associated with \textsc{Unix} is the \emph{Unix philosophy}.  The
\textsc{Unix} philosophy refers to some of the core principles with which it was
developed. The core principles involve composing many small simple programs that
accomplish one task well to solve more complex tasks \cite{raymond2003art}. The
idea of many small modular components has spread to many areas of computer
science including effect oriented programming.

\section{Effect Handlers and UNIX}

In chapter 2 of his 2022 thesis, Daniel Hillerstr\"{o}m
\cite{hillerstrom2022foundations} outlines a theoretical implementation of UNIX
using the effects syntax outlined by Kammar et. al. \cite{kammar2013handlers}.
In this he provides an implementation of the original \textsc{Unix} paper
\cite{ritchie1978unix} that includes a filesystem and timesharing.
Hillerstr\"{o}m makes several assumptions about the effect system that would
need to be taken into account in order to implement this with a real language.
The main assumption is multi-shot handlers. For example the implementation of
\texttt{fork} uses multi-shot handlers to copy the full stack on both branches.
There are also some partial implementations such as \texttt{sed} \footnote{It is
worth mentioning \texttt{sed} has $20,000+$ lines of code} from which he only
implements string replacement.
